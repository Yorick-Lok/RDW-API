# License_Plate_Data

Welcome to this README, I will now explain how License_Plate_Data.py works and how to use it.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

What you want to do first is run the file.

Then you need to enter a Dutch license plate in the first box.
You will then use the checkboxes to filter the results, so it only displays the ones you've selected.
Then when you're ready, you can view the data using the "Informatie bekijken" button.

-------Optional-------
You can also choose a province for MRB Calculation, this is the Motor Vehicle Tax.
Vehicles that use diesel are also dependant on the year of construction.
Vehicles that are 40 years or older are exempt from MRB, meaning it's free.
